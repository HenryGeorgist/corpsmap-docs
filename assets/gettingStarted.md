# Getting Started

If you are wanting to build a basic map with corpsmap, the first step would be to start by creating a new react app.

Open visual studio code in the directory where you want the new react application, and run the following three commands in order

```
$ npx create-react-app <your-app-name-HERE>
$ cd <your-app-name-here>
$ npm install @corpsmap/corpsmap redux-bundler redux-bundler-react
```

You will now be able to get started building your web page.
